Backyard Garden will be an educational android game application that targets young children 
before and during kindergarten. In this game, children will be able to interact with a backyard 
garden setting and have fun growing plants while learning basic math and science. There will be no 
“ending” to our game but it will have set up achievements to complete. After completing certain achievements, 
the game will introduce new educational concepts so that the child playing will be able to keep learning throughout 
the game at their own pace. We believe that this method will allow a child to desire learning rather than feel discouraged
about what they are doing. 

The game will begin with a friendly backyard setting with a plot of land designated for planting. 
The user will be prompted to place one seed in the dirt, water it, and give it some sunshine. 
They will then be able to see the seed grow into a seedling, and then the user will repeat the water and sunshine process.
After watering the plant and giving it sunshine twice, the plant will bloom into a flower and the user will have a basic 
understanding of plant growth. The user will be able to count how many seeds they need with a visual representation. 
This will begin teaching the user how to count from 1 to 10. 

	Currently, there is no replica game of our project idea and we are excited to offer it to parents. 
	We believe that they will appreciate and support our aim of teaching basic math and science to children in a fun new way. 
	Children are becoming familiar with trending technology at a higher rate and we believe that utilizing the android market to 
	showcase our project will help us gain popularity and profit. 

For this semester, we will focus on the most basic concepts as described above. 
However, we envision new educational topics added to a series of this game application in the future.
This will expand our consumer base and allow our current consumers to grow with us. The success of these applications 
could eventually lead our team to try selling our product to private and public schools and will be great to present to 
homeschooling families.
